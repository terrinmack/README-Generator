# README-Generator
Module 9: An application that uses node.js command=line prompts to generate a professional README.md file via the user's inputs. 

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install Node.js to your pc to utilize the application
3. Within the terminal, run npm install to install the inquirer package
4. The application can now be used.

## Usage
* The purpose of this application is to provide a simplified method for a user to create a professional README file for their personal use. Rather than needing to create a template on their own, it provides a streamlined guide for anyone to use and to later edit if needed. 
* After the user types "node index.js" within the terminal in the correct path, they will be presented with a series of input/list style questions. 
* Once the questions are all answered, the layout will be presented as:
    * Title
    * License:Badge
    * Description
    * Table of Contents
        * List with Href style links
    * Installation
    * Usage
    * Credits
    * Test
    * Contacts
* Example of a Sample README file that will be created:
